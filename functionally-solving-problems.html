        <h1>Functionally Solving Problems</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we'll take a look at a few interesting problems and how to think functionally to solve them as elegantly as possible. We probably won't be introducing any new concepts, we'll just be flexing our newly acquired Haskell muscles and practicing our coding skills. Each section will present a different problem. First we'll describe the problem, then we'll try and find out what the best (or least worst) way of solving it is.</p>
<a name="reverse-polish-notation-calculator"></a><h2>Reverse Polish notation calculator</h2>
<p>Usually when we write mathematical expressions in school, we write them in an infix manner. For instance, we write <span class="fixed">10 - (4 + 3) * 2</span>. <span class="fixed">+</span>, <span class="fixed">*</span> and <span class="fixed">-</span> are infix operators, just like the infix functions we met in Haskell (<span class="fixed">+</span>, <span class="fixed">`elem`</span>, etc.). This makes it handy because we, as humans, can parse it easily in our minds by looking at such an expression. The downside to it is that we have to use parentheses to denote precedence.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish notation</a> is another way of writing down mathematical expressions. Initially it looks a bit weird, but it's actually pretty easy to understand and use because there's no need for parentheses and it's very easy to punch into a calculator. While most modern calculators use infix notation, some people still swear by RPN calculators. This is what the previous infix expression looks like in RPN: <span class="fixed">10 4 3 + 2 * -</span>. How do we calculate what the result of that is? Well, think of a stack. You go over the expression from left to right. Every time a number is encountered, push it on to the stack. When we encounter an operator, take the two numbers that are on top of the stack (we also say that we <i>pop</i> them), use the operator and those two and then push the resulting number back onto the stack. When you reach the end of the expression, you should be left with a single number if the expression was well-formed and that number represents the result.</p>

<p>Let's go over the expression <span class="fixed">10 4 3 + 2 * -</span> together! First we push <span class="fixed">10</span> on to the stack and the stack is now <span class="fixed">10</span>. The next item is <span class="fixed">4</span>, so we push it to the stack as well. The stack is now <span class="fixed">10, 4</span>. We do the same with <span class="fixed">3</span> and the stack is now <span class="fixed">10, 4, 3</span>. And now, we encounter an operator, namely <span class="fixed">+</span>! We pop the two top numbers from the stack (so now the stack is just <span class="fixed">10</span>), add those numbers together and push that result to the stack. The stack is now <span class="fixed">10, 7</span>. We push <span class="fixed">2</span> to the stack, the stack for now is <span class="fixed">10, 7, 2</span>. We've encountered an operator again, so let's pop <span class="fixed">7</span> and <span class="fixed">2</span> off the stack, multiply them and push that result to the stack. Multiplying <span class="fixed">7</span> and <span class="fixed">2</span> produces a <span class="fixed">14</span>, so the stack we have now is <span class="fixed">10, 14</span>. Finally, there's a <span class="fixed">-</span>. We pop <span class="fixed">10</span> and <span class="fixed">14</span> from the stack, subtract <span class="fixed">14</span> from <span class="fixed">10</span> and push that back. The number on the stack is now <span class="fixed">-4</span> and because there are no more numbers or operators in our expression, that's our result!</p>
<p>Now that we know how we'd calculate any RPN expression by hand, let's think about how we could make a Haskell function that takes as its parameter a string that contains a RPN expression, like <span class="fixed">"10 4 3 + 2 * -"</span> and gives us back its result.</p>
<p>What would the type of that function be? We want it to take a string as a parameter and produce a number as its result. So it will probably be something like <span class="fixed">solveRPN :: (Num a) =&gt; String -&gt; a</span>.</p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Protip:</em> it really helps to first think what the type declaration of a function should be before concerning ourselves with the implementation and then write it down. In Haskell, a function's type declaration tells us a whole lot about the function, due to the very strong type system.</div>

<p>Cool. When implementing a solution to a problem in Haskell, it's also good to think back on how you did it by hand and maybe try to see if you can gain any insight from that. Here we see that we treated every number or operator that was separated by a space as a single item. So it might help us if we start by breaking a string like <span class="fixed">"10 4 3 + 2 * -"</span> into a list of items like <span class="fixed">["10","4","3","+","2","*","-"]</span>.</p>
<p>Next up, what did we do with that list of items in our head? We went over it from left to right and kept a stack as we did that. Does the previous sentence remind you of anything? Remember, in the section about <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions/#folds">folds</a>, we said that pretty much any function where you traverse a list from left to right or right to left one element by element and build up (accumulate) some result (whether it's a number, a list, a stack, whatever) can be implemented with a fold.</p>
<p>In this case, we're going to use a left fold, because we go over the list from left to right. The accumulator value will be our stack and hence, the result from the fold will also be a stack, only as we've seen, it will only have one item.</p>
<p>One more thing to think about is, well, how are we going to represent the stack? I propose we use a list. Also I propose that we keep the top of our stack at the head of the list. That's because adding to the head (beginning) of a list is much faster than adding to the end of it. So if we have a stack of, say, <span class="fixed">10, 4, 3</span>, we'll represent that as the list <span class="fixed">[3,4,10]</span>.</p>
<p>Now we have enough information to roughly sketch our function. It's going to take a string, like, <span class="fixed">"10 4 3 + 2 * -"</span> and break it down into a list of items by using <span class="fixed">words</span> to get <span class="fixed">["10","4","3","+","2","*","-"]</span>. Next, we'll do a left fold over that list and end up with a stack that has a single item, so <span class="fixed">[-4]</span>. We take that single item out of the list and that's our final result!</p>
<p>So here's a sketch of that function:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">import Data.List

solveRPN :: (Num a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
solveRPN expression = head (foldl foldingFunction [] (words expression))
    where   foldingFunction stack item = ...
</pre>
<p>We take the expression and turn it into a list of items. Then we fold over that list of items with the folding function. Mind the <span class="fixed">[]</span>, which represents the starting accumulator. The accumulator is our stack, so <span class="fixed">[]</span> represents an empty stack, which is what we start with. After getting the final stack with a single item, we call <span class="fixed">head</span> on that list to get the item out and then we apply <span class="fixed">read</span>.</p>
<p>So all that's left now is to implement a folding function that will take a stack, like <span class="fixed">[4,10]</span>, and an item, like <span class="fixed">"3"</span> and return a new stack <span class="fixed">[3,4,10]</span>. If the stack is <span class="fixed">[4,10]</span> and the item <span class="fixed">"*"</span>, then it will have to return <span class="fixed">[40]</span>. But before that, let's turn our function into <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions#composition">point-free style</a> because it has a lot of parentheses that are kind of freaking me out:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">import Data.List

solveRPN :: (Num a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words
    where   foldingFunction stack item = ...
</pre>
<p>Ah, there we go. Much better. So, the folding function will take a stack and an item and return a new stack. We'll use pattern matching to get the top items of a stack and to pattern match against operators like <span class="fixed">"*"</span> and <span class="fixed">"-"</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">solveRPN :: (Num a, Read a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words
    where   foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "*" = (x * y):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "+" = (x + y):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "-" = (y - x):ys
            foldingFunction xs numberString = read numberString:xs
</pre>
<p>We laid this out as four patterns. The patterns will be tried from top to bottom. First the folding function will see if the current item is <span class="fixed">"*"</span>. If it is, then it will take a list like <span class="fixed">[3,4,9,3]</span> and call its first two elements <span class="fixed">x</span> and <span class="fixed">y</span> respectively. So in this case, <span class="fixed">x</span> would be <span class="fixed">3</span> and <span class="fixed">y</span> would be <span class="fixed">4</span>. <span class="fixed">ys</span> would be <span class="fixed">[9,3]</span>. It will return a list that's just like <span class="fixed">ys</span>, only it has <span class="fixed">x</span> and <span class="fixed">y</span> multiplied as its head. So with this we pop the two topmost numbers off the stack, multiply them and push the result back on to the stack. If the item is not <span class="fixed">"*"</span>, the pattern matching will fall through and <span class="fixed">"+"</span> will be checked, and so on.</p>
<p>If the item is none of the operators, then we assume it's a string that represents a number. If it's a number, we just call <span class="fixed">read</span> on that string to get a number from it and return the previous stack but with that number pushed to the top.</p>
<p>And that's it! Also noticed that we added an extra class constraint of <span class="fixed">Read a</span> to the function declaration, because we call <span class="fixed">read</span> on our string to get the number. So this declaration means that the result can be of any type that's part of the <span class="fixed">Num</span> and <span class="fixed">Read</span> typeclasses (like <span class="fixed">Int</span>, <span class="fixed">Float</span>, etc.). </p>
<p>For the list of items <span class="fixed">["2","3","+"]</span>, our function will start folding from the left. The intial stack will be <span class="fixed">[]</span>. It will call the folding function with <span class="fixed">[]</span> as the stack (accumulator) and <span class="fixed">"2"</span> as the item. Because that item is not an operator, it will be <span class="fixed">read</span> and the added to the beginning of <span class="fixed">[]</span>. So the new stack is now <span class="fixed">[2]</span> and the folding function will be called with <span class="fixed">[2]</span> as the stack and <span class="fixed">["3"]</span> as the item, producing a new stack of <span class="fixed">[3,2]</span>. Then, it's called for the third time with <span class="fixed">[3,2]</span> as the stack and <span class="fixed">"+"</span> as the item. This causes these two numbers to be popped off the stack, added together and pushed back. The final stack is <span class="fixed">[5]</span>, which is the number that we return.</p>
<p>Let's play around with our function:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">ghci&gt; solveRPN "10 4 3 + 2 * -"
-4
ghci&gt; solveRPN "2 3 +"
5
ghci&gt; solveRPN "90 34 12 33 55 66 + * - +"
-3947
ghci&gt; solveRPN "90 34 12 33 55 66 + * - + -"
4037
ghci&gt; solveRPN "90 34 12 33 55 66 + * - + -"
4037
ghci&gt; solveRPN "90 3 -"
87
</pre>
<p>Cool, it works! One nice thing about this function is that it can be easily modified to support various other operators. They don't even have to be binary operators. For instance, we can make an operator <span class="fixed">"log"</span> that just pops one number off the stack </p></div></div></body></html>
